policykit-1: transitional package for polkitd and pkexec 

This transitional package depends on polkitd, the system service used by
polkit, and pkexec, a setuid program analogous to sudo. They were
historically packaged together, but have been separated so that users of
polkitd are not required to install pkexec.
